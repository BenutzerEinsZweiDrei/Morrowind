BSAUnpacker by Timeslip

Requires .NET 2.0!

***********
** Usage **
***********

This is a utility for viewing the files contained within an morrowind bsa archive and
unpacking them. To use, just run the exe file. Click open and select the bsa archive you
want to extract. A list of files contained within the archive will be displayed.

You can extract a single file by double clicking on it, extract multiple files by
selecting them and then clicking extract, or extract the whole archive by clicking extract
all.

You can drag/drop a file from the BSA unpacker to windows explorer, or to any other program
which accepts file drops.

You can also sort the files contained in the archive using the combo box to the right.
Select the variable you wish to sort by, and click sort. (It isn't kept sorted
automatically, for speed reasons.) 

*****************
** Limitations **
*****************

This is a straight conversion of the BSA unpacker of obmm 1.1.0. obmm's preview feature
that allowed you to preview textures and meshes without unpacking them has been removed,
because it would have required converting obmm's NifViewer component to work with morrowind
BSA's.

I played no part in decoding the BSA file format. iirc ghostwheel was the first to
do it for morrowind, although this utility is based entirally on the data taken from
uesp.
