### Promotional
This little webpage is promotional of the game. It's not a tech demo for three.js nor a Chrome Experiment.

### More like a visual tour of Vvardenfell
I don't mean to reimplement Morrowind as a game, like OpenMW. I'm using retextured meshes from the Overhaul 3.0 mod, so there's high-res stuff and everything looks gorgeous.

### Controls
* `Capslock` to move slow
* `M` to freeze
* `N` to attach / detach shadow camera
